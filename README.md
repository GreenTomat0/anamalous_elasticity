# Displacement fields in amorphous solids caused by distributed stress sources

This project aims to study the behavior of the displacement fields arising in the amorphous system with distributed stress sources.

The primary computations are performed using LAMMPS (<a href="https://www.lammps.org/#gsc.tab=0" />). Key LAMMPS input files include:
<ul>
  <li>in.2D-Ring-Inflate</li>
  <li>in.2D-RingEqui</li>
</ul>

Supplemental computations are performd in Python and include 
<ul>
  <li>Calculating average angle displacements</li>
  <li>Fitting data to anomalous and elastic distributions</li>
  <li>Computing boundary pressure, etc.</li>
</ul>
